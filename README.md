# Deforestation Project
Tree Cover Loss in the United States by Percent 2001-2020 <br>
This data was gathered from <a href="https://rainforests.mongabay.com/deforestation/archive/United_States.htm">Deforestation statistics for United States</a><nr>
I used Power BI to create the visualization.<br>
There is a picture of the heat map included if you don't have Power BI to view it.<br>
